# doxymatlab

This package allows you to extract automatically comments from your Matlab .m files using Doxygen to generate documentation.

This package provides :
- a perl script (m2cpp.pl) used to filter the .m files so that Doxygen can understand them
- a template for the Doxyfile file (configuration file for Doxygen) which has to be modified according to the location of your code
- documentationGuidelines.m, an .m file which describes how you should comment your code so that Doxygen can extract it and create nice documentation
- classDocumentationExample.m : an .m file describing possible comment for classes
- all the documentation (html format) automatically generated by Doxygen from the two .m files (see Doc/html/index.html), which provides informations about installation and how to write Doxygen comments.

## Installation

- You need to have the Doxygen software installed (version 1.5.9 or newer required (tested with version 1.8.12))
- You need to have perl installed (perl is shipped with Matlab, located usually in $matlabroot\sys\perl\win32\bin)
- unzip the DoxygenMatlab.zip to C:\DoxygenMatlbab (for example)
- get the Doxyfile file from the C:\DoxygenMatlbab directory and replace the default Doxyfile provided by Doxygen
- edit the Doxyfile file (or use the DoxyWizard tool provided by Doxygen) to modify a few settings:
    * EXTENSION_MAPPING=.m=C++
    * FILTER_PATTERN=*m=C:\DoxygenMatlbab\m2cpp.pl  (m2cpp.bat on Windows platform)
	* FILTER_SOURCE_PATTERNS=C:\DoxygenMatlbab\m2srcm.pl (m2srcm.bat on Windows platform)
    * PERL_PATH=<path to your perl version>
    * INPUT=<directory where your documented code is located>
    * OUTPUT_DIRECTORY=<directory where you want to generate your documentation>
    * STRIP_FORM_PATH=<directory where your documented code is located>

### Note for Windows users

Use the bat files instead of .pl scripts for both FILTER_PATTERN and FILTER_SOURCE_PATTERNS settings as explained above.

### Note for Linux/Mac users

Run the provided script convertToUnix.sh to strip the carriage return and the .exe extension from the script.

## Usage

### Source browser

To enable the source browser edit the Doxyfile as follow:

    FILTER_SOURCE_FILES    = YES
    SOURCE_BROWSER         = YES
    FILTER_SOURCE_PATTERNS = *m=C:\DoxygenMatlbab\m2srcm.pl (m2srcm.bat on Windows platform)

The script m2srcm.pl probably needs more testing, so may not work in general.
